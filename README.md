# Attack of the Dollar Generals


Dollar stores are ubiquitous throughout the US however Dollar General in particular has been growing at breakneck pace. Dollar General has been accused of being  predatory in its practices and bad for the poor . On the other hand it has been lauded as a company that will "go where Walmart won't" by bringing retail to  rural America and providing much needed jobs. I aim to build a predictive model that can predict whether a town has a Dollar General or not based on income and demographic data. This can also answer/shed light into whether the accusations against Dollar General are true or if the areas that Dollar Generals really do gain income.

My motivation for this project is to highlight DGâ€™s strategy in moving forward and predict where it can move in the future and to uncover whether they are moving to target certain demographics or if they are simply casting a wide net.
