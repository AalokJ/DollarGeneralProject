# Attack of the Dollar Generals: A Location Analysis of Dollar General Stores
Author: Aalok Joshi 
# Background
Dollar stores, also known as variety stores or general stores, have been around in the United States since the early 20th century. Generally speaking, they are retail stores which sell a wide variety of items for discounted or fixed price points. Historically these price points have been five cents, ten cents, or a dollar - leading to their generally accepted name being dollar stores. 
Today dollar stores are ubiquitous throughout the US and much of the world. If you are reading this right now its very likely you have been to a dollar store and that there is one in your hometown. There are three industry leading chains that dominate the dollar store landscape today - namely, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, and the focus of this project Dollar General. Since its inception in 1955 Dollar General has grown at a breakneck speed. By 1968 Dollar General had roughly 300 stores and went public on the stock exchange, however, this success is nothing compared to what they have done in the past four decades. Today Dollar General stands at almost 18,000 stores spread across 46 states. In an era when retail has been dying a slow death - Dollar General has bucked the trend and not only avoided stagnation but rather has exploded. This begs the obvious question... how do they do it?
Well, Dollar General has been accused of being [predatory](https://slate.com/business/2021/07/dollar-general-food-deserts-grocery-stores.html) in its practices and [bad for the poor](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/business/dollar-general-opposition/index.html). On the other hand it has been lauded as a company that will "go where Walmart won't" by bringing retail to [rural America](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/13/dollar-general-walmart-buhler-haven-kansas) and providing much needed jobs. I aim to build a predictive model that can predict whether a town has a Dollar General or not based on income and demographic data. This can also answer/shed light into whether the accusations against Dollar General are true or if the areas that Dollar Generals really do stand to gain from stores being present.

# Overview
My motivation for this project is to investigate how Dollar General has choosen to open its stores throughout the country and to shed light ont the accusations that Dollar General is targetting rural and poor Americans in particular. 

I have choosen Dollar General for a couple reasons:
1. It has over 18,000 stores and is prevalant in almost every state in the country
2. It continues to grow amidst a retail climate that has seen many large players shrink their physical footprint - with plans for 1000 more stores in the next 4 years.
3. Their business has attracted the attention of media houses like CNN, WSJ, NYT, The Guardian, etc. 

# Business Objective
From a business perspective this project has applications for a wide range of roles and industries. The findings apply to Dollar General itself, but also to its competitors who have failed to expand at the pace that Dollar General has. By setting out to categorize counties into those having Dollar Generals or not, this project is able to create a profile of what a Dollar General county looks like compared to a non Dollar General county. Based on the data the two different types of counties can be profiled by demographics, income, income per capita, occupation, occupational industry, gender, and many more features. This can also be insightful for private equity firms, consulting firms, and research firms interested in this space.
