    "Dollar stores, also known as variety stores or general stores, have been around in the United States since the early 20th century. Generally speaking, they are retail stores which sell a wide variety of items for discounted or fixed price points. Historically these price points have been five cents, ten cents, or a dollar - leading to their generally accepted name being dollar stores. Today dollar stores are ubiquitous throughout the US and much of the world. If you are reading this right now its very likely you have been to a dollar store and that there is one in your hometown. There are three industry leading chains that dominate the dollar store landscape today - namely, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, and the focus of this project Dollar General. Since its inception in 1955 Dollar General has grown at a breakneck speed. By 1968 Dollar General had roughly 300 stores and went public on the stock exchange, however, this success is nothing compared to what they have done in the past four decades. Today Dollar General stands at almost 18,000 stores spread across 46 states. In an era when retail has been dying a slow death - Dollar General has bucked the trend and not only avoided stagnation but rather has exploded. This begs the obvious question... how do they do it? Well, Dollar General has been accused of being predatory in its practices and bad for the poor. On the other hand it has been lauded as a company that will \"go where Walmart won't\" by bringing retail to rural America and providing much needed jobs. I aim to build a predictive model that can predict whether a town has a Dollar General or not based on income and demographic data. This can also answer/shed light into whether the accusations against Dollar General are true or if the areas that Dollar Generals really do stand to gain from stores being present."

    "It has over 18,000 stores and is prevalant in almost every state in the country.\n",

    "It continues to grow amidst a retail climate that has seen many large players shrink their physical footprint - with plans for 1000 more stores in the next 4 years.\n",

    "From a business perspective this project has applications for a wide range of roles and industries. The findings apply to Dollar General itself, but also to its competitors who have failed to expand at the pace that Dollar General has. By setting out to categorize counties into those having Dollar Generals or not, this project is able to create a profile of what a Dollar General county looks like compared to a non Dollar General county. Based on the data the two different types of counties can be profiled by demographics, income, income per capita, occupation, occupational industry, gender, and many more features. This can also be insightful for private equity firms, consulting firms, and research firms interested in this space."

Additionally, out of the top ten states with the most DG stores seven of them are in the South. Another trend that stands out is that DG is extremely prevelant in the South and the Midwest and comparatively has a small presence in either the Northeast or the West Coast. In fact, the Northeast or West Coast state with the most Dollar Generals, New York, is a paltry seventeenth on the list. This already suggests that Dollar General has specifically focused on the South and the Midwest in their expansion strategy."

    "The above graph provides some very interesting insight. Firstly, it is important to note that the smaller the bar / lower the \"People per Store\" number the more stores Dollar General has per person in that state. So essentially Mississipi has the most Dollar General stores per capita and Washington has the least. Broadly speaking, it seems that some of the most rural and poorest states have the most Dollar General stores while some of the wealthiest ststes have the least Dollar General stores. The 5 states with the least amount of people per Dollar General store ( most stores per capita) are Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The 5 states with the most amount of people per Dollar General stores (least stores per capita) are Washington, Utah, California, Nevada, Massachusetts, and Colorado. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other than income, geographical location also stands out. The 5 states with most stores per capita are all in the South (West Virginia is borderline) while the 5 states with least stores per capita are all in the West or the Northeast. As mentioned before the Dollar General brand is most prevalant in the South and Midwest while the Northeast and West coast are still not saturated with Dollar General stores. "

It seems like all of the data in the column to the right of \"County\" are all numerical data. It also seems like many of them are percentages. The race/ethnicity columns- 'Hispanic', 'White', 'Black', 'Native', 'Asian', 'Pacific' are all percentages that (theoretically) add up to 100%. This is the same situation for the employment type columns - 'Professional', 'Service', 'Office', 'Construction','Production'- the transportation type columns - 'Drive', 'Carpool', 'Transit', 'Walk', 'OtherTransp','WorkAtHome' - and the employment status columns - 'PrivateWork', 'PublicWork','SelfEmployed', 'FamilyWork', 'Unemployment'. The 'Employed','MeanCommute', 'Income', 'IncomeErr', 'TotalPop', 'Men', 'Women' columns are nominal variables. Finally the 'Poverty' and 'ChildPoverty' columns are percentages as well - however they do not total 100% together."

    "All three models performed relatively similarly, however, the Random Forest model was the best one. Below are the AUC curves for all three of the models. The most important and insightful metric for an analysis like this is the precision score. The precision score is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. The precision score is insightful because it allows us to see the false positves aka the counties that do NOT have a Dollar General but which our model has incorrectly classified as having a Dollar General. These counties are ripe for expansion and, according to our model, they fit the profile of a Dollar General county. For our three models, Decision Tree, Log Regression, and Random Forest the precision scores are 80.9%, 81.5%, 84.0% respectively. Therefore Random Forest is the best model for this project."

    "The Final Model that works the best would be - the Random Forest model with 110 trees that uses entropy as its criterion for splitting. The Random Forest model is the better than the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree categorization models because of its superior precision score. While the metrics of all three models are relatively similar the precision score is the paramount metric in an analysis like this. The metric that matters the most in an analysis like this is precision score - aka how many of the counties predicted to have Dollar General's actually do. Using this we can take a look at our false positive counties which could be counties that are ripe for expansion of Dollar General into. These false positives are counties that the model falsely categorized as having dollar generals and so they meet certain criteria that fit the profile of Dollar General Counties."
